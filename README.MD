# ETHICALAuras

ETHICAL Auras is a Valheim mod that helps players track essential buffs. It provides configurable visual and audio alerts when monitored buffs are missing.

## Features

### Buff Tracking
- **Visual Alerts**: Flashing icons for missing buffs
- **Audio Alerts**: Customizable sound notifications
- **Smart Zone Awareness**: Track buffs only in biomes where they matter (because who needs frost resistance in the Meadows?)
- **Interactive Selection Menu**: Browse and select buffs with a user-friendly interface (F6 to open)

### Configuration Options

#### General Settings
- **Tracked Buffs**: Select which buffs to monitor through the in-game menu
- **Icon Display**: Customize size, position, and spacing of buff icons
- **Zone Awareness**: Enable/disable tracking in specific biomes:
  - Meadows
  - Black Forest
  - Swamp
  - Mountain
  - Plains
  - Mistlands
  - Ocean
  - Ashlands
  - Deep North

#### Audio Settings
- **Enable Audio Alerts**: Toggle sound notifications
- **Loop Audio**: Choose whether the alert should loop (for those who really need the reminder)
- **Alert Sound**: Select from available audio clips:
  - Scream: double wraith death wail (for maximum panic)
  - Creatine: creatine does nothing (surprised?)

#### Display Settings
- **Icon Size**: Adjust the size of buff icons (20-200 pixels)
- **Icon Position**: Choose from 9 different screen positions
- **Icon Spacing**: Customize the gap between icons
