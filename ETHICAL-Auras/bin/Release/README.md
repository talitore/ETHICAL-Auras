# ETHICALAuras

ETHICAL Auras is a Valheim mod that helps players track essential buffs. It provides configurable visual and audio alerts when monitored buffs are missing.

## Configuration
The mod allows users to customize its behavior via a configuration file (`com.talitore.ethicalauras.cfg`), managed by BepInEx's ConfigurationManager. Key configurable aspects include:
-   **Tracked Buffs**: Specify a comma-separated list of in-game buff names to monitor.
-   **Audio Alerts**: Enable or disable audio notifications for missing buffs.
-   **Loop Audio**: Choose whether the audio alert should loop or play once.
-   **Alert Sound**: Select from available audio clips for the alert.
